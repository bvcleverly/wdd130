    <h2>Blake Cleverly</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Blake Cleverly.  I am learning online and working towards my Applied Technology degree.
      I work full time so only get about one class done a semester.
    </p>
    <p>My job is working on blood testing equipment in hospital labs and clinics.
      I travel a bit for work, 60-70,000 miles per year.  I would like to get off the road and be able to work remotely.
    </p>
    <p>I am married and have four children, I am the old guy in the center of the pic.  Yes I am missing some hair and have a bit extra around the middle.
