      <h3>Welcome to 3Bees Bakery!</h3>
        <p>
          Our three Bees are Bruchele, and her daughters Brooke, and Brielle.
          Our founder, Bruchele, has been baking decadent delights for decades.
          One of her memories growing up is baking pies the night before Thanksgiving.
          Her experieince began with baking bread, then she ventured into cakes, pies, cookies, cheesecakes, and other wonderful delectables. 
          Growing up in baked bread was a staple, and the variety of breads varied.
          Breads had different flours, whole wheat, cracked wheat, bleached or white, oat, rye, barley, buckwheat, pastry, cake, etc.
          As the girls grew they ventured into different baking adventures, straying from the breads into cookies, and then cakes.
          One of the favorite items in the house is cheesecake made from scratch.  All three have developed the knack for a good cheesecake.
          Brooke even did a science fair project determining the best way to bake cheesecakes for consistency, lack of cracking, and crust form.
          Her efforts were rewarded with a trip to the state competition.
          From this experience their proficiency was made evident as they began to sell cheesecakes for people's birthdays or other special events.
          Our three bakers now enjoy sharing their skills and providing others with delicious goodies.
          We invite you to explore our services and wares, and hope to serve you either in our store or catering your event.

      <h3>Pastries and Goodies</h3>
      <p>
        What goody is your inclination?  Are you craving a slice of Pie, Danish, Doughnut, Mille-Feuille, Cookie, Eclair,  
        Perhaps something a little less sweet, look over our breads, bagels, and biscuits.
        Our cheesecakes range from plain, to marbled, with designs.
        One of my favorite has both chocolate marbling, and almond flavoring.
        Cheesecake flavors, include Blueberry, Cherry, Chocolate, Chocolate Marble, Chokecherry, Peach, or order it plain and add your own favorite syrup or pie filling.
        We add designs on the top to match the occasion.  These can range from a flavored topping like cherry pie filling, or powdered sugar dusted across the top of a chocolate cake displaying snowflakes, or cocoa powder over a plain.
        We can create a  message in powder sugar, cocoa, or flavored syrup such as HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CONGRATULATIONS, HAPPY 50TH, etc.
        Need a cake for a birthday?  Graduation?  Wedding?  Look at our various options including sheet cakes, Bundt cakes, decorated customized cakes in various shapes and sizes.
        Looking for something a little more exotic, how about some Baklava.

      <h3>Brunch and Catering</h3>
      <p>
        Before your appetite is satisfied with the sweets, find some energy and nutrition as you have a bit of brunch or lunch.
        We offer a variety of sandwich styles and fillings.  Check out our usual proteins and veg offered on various breads and wraps, including Croissants, fresh baked Sour Dough, or Whole Grain breads.
        Standard fillings include Roast Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Ham, Chicken salad, Roast Chicken, and Tuna.  Other occasional stars include Salmon, Peperoni, Roast Pork, etc.
        Most days we also offer specials to increase variety and expose your palate to new or infrequent fare.
       We also do some specials, one favorite main is Chili Cheese Loaf, a spiced filling of hamburger and cheese baked in homemade bread.
       Looking for a comfort food from youth, how about a cheese toast of swiss, cheddar, or even mozzarella, with a cup of Tomato soup?
       Come the holiday season we offer warm drinks, come by while shopping for a quick sip of spiced cider, pumpkin spice, or mint cocoa.
       Keep your eyes on our Specials Board we have been known to have Stuffed grapeleaves, Runzas, Kibbah, and other options depending on demand, supplies, etc.
        Not seeing what you are looking for, inquire with one of the Bees and see if they can make a special order, or add an item to the menu.
