      <h3>Welcome to 3Bees Bakery!</h3>
        <p>
          Our three Bees are Bruchele, and her daughters Brooke, and Brielle.
          Our founder, Bruchele, has been baking decadent delights for decades.
          One of her memories growing up is baking pies the night before Thanksgiving.
          Her experieince began with baking bread, cakes, pies, cookies, and cheesecakes. 
          As her daughters, Brooke and Brielle, grew they also learned about baking and tantalizing peoples taste buds.
          Brooke even did a science fair project determining the best way to bake cheesecakes for consistency, lack of cracking, and crust form.
          Her efforts were rewarded with a trip to the state competition.

          Our three bakers now enjoy sharing their skills and providing others with delicious goodies.
          We invite you to explore our services and wares, and hope to serve you either in our store or catering your event.

      <h3>Pastries and Goodies</h3>
      <p>
        What goody is your inclination?  Are you craving a slice of Apple pie?
        Perhaps something a little less sweet, look over our breads, bagels, and biscuits.
        Our cheesecakes range from plain, to marbled, with designs.
        One of my favorite has both chocolate marbling, and almond flavoring.
        Cheesecake flavors, include Blueberry, Cherry, Chocolate, Chocalate Marble, Chokecherry, Peach, or order it plain and add your own favorite syrup or pie filling.
        Need a cake for a birthday?  Graduation?  Wedding?  Look at our various options including sheet cakes, Bundt cakes, decorated customized cakes in various shapes and sizes.
        Looking for something a little more exotic, how about some Baklava.
