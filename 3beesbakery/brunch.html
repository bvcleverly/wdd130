                <h2>Before your appetite is satisfied with the sweets, find some energy and nutrition as you have a bit of brunch or lunch.
                    We offer a variety of sandwich styles and fillings.  Check out our usual proteins and veg offered on various breads and wraps, including Croissants, fresh baked Sour Dough, or Whole Grain breads.
                    Standard fillings include Roast Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Ham, Chicken salad, Roast Chicken, and Tuna.  Other occasional stars include Salmon, Peperoni, Roast Pork, etc.
                    Most days we also offer specials to increase variety and expose your palate to new or infrequent fare.
                   We also do some specials, one favorite main is Chili Cheese Loaf, a spiced filling of hamburger and cheese baked in homemade bread.
                   Looking for a comfort food from youth, how about a cheese toast of swiss, cheddar, or even mozzarella, with a cup of Tomato soup?
                   Come the holiday season we offer warm drinks, come by while shopping for a quick sip of spiced cider, pumpkin spice, or mint cocoa.
                   Keep your eyes on our Specials Board we have been known to have Stuffed grapeleaves, Runzas, Kibbah, and other options depending on demand, supplies, etc.
                    Not seeing what you are looking for, inquire with one of the Bees and see if they can make a special order, or add an item to the menu.
