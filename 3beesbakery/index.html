                <h2>Our three Bees are Bruchele, and her daughters Brooke, and Brielle.
                    Our founder, Bruchele, has been baking decadent delights for decades.
                    One of her memories growing up is baking pies the night before Thanksgiving.
                    Her experieince began with baking bread, then she ventured into cakes, pies, cookies, cheesecakes, and other wonderful delectables. 
                    Growing up in baked bread was a staple, and the variety of breads varied.
                    Breads had different flours, whole wheat, cracked wheat, bleached or white, oat, rye, barley, buckwheat, pastry, cake, etc.
                    As the girls grew they ventured into different baking adventures, straying from the breads into cookies, and then cakes.
                    One of the favorite items in the house is cheesecake made from scratch.  All three have developed the knack for a good cheesecake.
                    Brooke even did a science fair project determining the best way to bake cheesecakes for consistency, lack of cracking, and crust form.
                    Her efforts were rewarded with a trip to the state competition.
                    From this experience their proficiency was made evident as they began to sell cheesecakes for people's birthdays or other special events.
                    Our three bakers now enjoy sharing their skills and providing others with delicious goodies.
                    We invite you to explore our services and wares, and hope to serve you either in our store or catering your event.
